# Domain-Driven Context Architecture Implementation

## Key Accomplishments

# 1. Complete DashboardContext Refactoring
- Decomposed monolithic DashboardContext (959 lines) into focused domain contexts
- Implemented domain-driven design principles for context separation
- Created context composition pattern with proper dependency management

# 2. New Domain-Specific Contexts
- UserContext.js (187 lines) - User profile, authentication, and user lookup
- ProgramContext.js (274 lines) - Programs, initiatives, cohorts, and milestones
- TeamContext.js (203 lines) - Team management and selection
- EducationContext.js (132 lines) - Education records and operations
- DashboardProvider.js (73 lines) - Context composition and orchestration

# 3. Backward Compatibility System
- Updated DashboardContext to act as a bridge/adapter to domain contexts
- Implemented LegacyContextBridge to maintain API compatibility
- Ensured existing components will continue to work without modification

# 4. Enhanced Education Domain
- Integrated education hooks into EducationContext
- Created example component demonstrating domain context usage
- Completed implementation of education domain in the DDD architecture

# 5. Documentation
- Created comprehensive CONTEXT_REFACTORING.md (145 lines)
- Updated AIRTABLE_REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md with latest changes
- Added detailed code comments throughout context implementations

## Technical Architecture

# Context Hierarchy
UserProvider → ProgramProvider → TeamProvider → EducationProvider

# Dual Access API
- Legacy: useDashboard() - For backward compatibility
- Domain-specific: useUserContext(), useProgramContext(), etc.

# Component Integration
- Created EducationProfileExample.js demonstrating new context pattern
- Showcased combining multiple domain contexts in a single component

## Benefits

# 1. Improved Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Smaller, focused context files
- Domain-specific operations grouped logically

# 2. Better Performance
- More granular context subscriptions
- Fewer unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized dependencies between contexts

# 3. Enhanced Developer Experience
- Domain-specific hooks with focused APIs
- Better IDE autocompletion
- Clearer responsibility boundaries

# 4. Robust Architecture
- Follows industry best practices for React context
- Clear migration path from old to new architecture
- Maintains backward compatibility for gradual adoption

## Version Control
- Created context-improvements branch for development
- Successfully merged changes into main branch
- Pushed final code to GitHub repository

## Next Steps
1. Create UI-specific context for shared UI state management
2. Gradually refactor existing components to use domain-specific contexts
3. Add comprehensive testing for each domain context
4. Continue other domain implementations using this architecture pattern
