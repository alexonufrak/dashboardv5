After reviewing the codebase in detail, I think there are several opportunities to improve the data fetching and user profile initialization. Let's explore these
  ideas:

  Moving Profile Fetching to Step 1

  Benefits of initializing user profile fetching earlier:

  1. Early Data Availability: Critical user data would be available sooner in the application lifecycle
  2. Reduced Waterfall Requests: Less sequential API calls that depend on each other
  3. Better User Experience: Faster initial render with relevant data
  4. More Predictable State: Less possibility of components rendering with incomplete data

  Potential Implementation:

  // In _app.js or a dedicated initialization module
  function initializeAppData(user) {
    const queryClient = useQueryClient();

    // Prefetch user profile immediately after authentication
    if (user) {
      queryClient.prefetchQuery({
        queryKey: ['profile'],
        queryFn: async () => {
          const response = await fetch('/api/user/profile');
          if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch profile');
          return response.json();
        }
      });
    }
  }

  Downsides:

  1. Potentially Unnecessary Fetches: If the user navigates to a non-dashboard page first
  2. Auth Dependencies: Need to ensure Auth0 is initialized before starting data fetches
  3. More Complex SSR Handling: Need to handle server-side rendering carefully

  Enhancing getCompleteUserProfile

  The current getCompleteUserProfile function in userProfile.js could be significantly enhanced to provide a more complete profile in a single call. This would reduce
  the number of API calls needed throughout the application.

  Recommended Improvements:

  1. Include Participation Data: Add participation records directly in the complete profile
  2. Include Team Data: Fetch and include team information to avoid separate team API calls
  3. Add Onboarding Status Processing: Determine and include onboarding status directly in the profile
  4. Optimize Airtable Lookups: Use SEARCH formulas to fetch related data more efficiently
  5. Add Caching Header: Set appropriate cache headers to improve performance

  Example Implementation:

  export async function getCompleteUserProfile(auth0User) {
    try {
      // Extract basic profile data from Auth0
      const basicProfile = {
        auth0Id: auth0User.sub,
        email: auth0User.email,
        name: auth0User.name,
        picture: auth0User.picture,
      }

      // Fetch Airtable profile (existing)
      const airtableProfile = await getUserProfile(auth0User.sub, auth0User.email)

      if (!airtableProfile) {
        return { ...basicProfile, isProfileComplete: false }
      }

      // NEW: Fetch participation, team data, and other related data in parallel
      const [
        participationRecords,
        teamRecords,
        milestoneRecords
      ] = await Promise.all([
        getParticipationRecords(airtableProfile.contactId),
        getUserTeams(airtableProfile.contactId),
        // Only fetch if we have active participations
        participationRecords?.length > 0 ?
          Promise.all(participationRecords.map(p =>
            p.cohort?.id ? getMilestonesForCohort(p.cohort.id) : []
          )) : []
      ]);

      // Process participation data
      const hasActiveParticipation = participationRecords &&
                                    participationRecords.length > 0;

      // Determine onboarding status
      const onboardingStatus = airtableProfile.Onboarding ||
                              (hasActiveParticipation ? "Applied" : "Registered");

      // Create the complete profile with all the data
      const completeProfile = {
        ...basicProfile,
        ...airtableProfile,
        // Make sure onboarding status is explicitly included
        Onboarding: onboardingStatus,
        // Include directly determined properties
        hasActiveParticipation,
        isOnboardingComplete: onboardingStatus === "Applied" || hasActiveParticipation,
        // Include related data
        participations: participationRecords || [],
        teams: teamRecords || [],
        milestones: milestoneRecords.flat() || [],
        // Existing fields...
      };

      return completeProfile;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in getCompleteUserProfile:", error)
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch complete user profile")
    }
  }

  Optimizing Airtable.js

  The airtable.js file could be optimized to fetch more data in fewer calls:

  1. Add Linked Table Data: Enhance getUserProfile to join related data in a single query
  2. Batch Queries: Use batched queries for related records to reduce API calls
  3. Explicit Onboarding Field: Always include and process the Onboarding field

  Example Enhancement to getUserProfile:

  export async function getUserProfile(userId, email) {
    try {
      // Existing email normalization and lookup code...

      // Enhance the query to include linked tables
      const records = await contactsTable
        .select({
          filterByFormula: `LOWER({Email})="${normalizedEmail}"`,
          maxRecords: 1,
          // Specify fields to reduce payload size
          fields: [
            "Email", "First Name", "Last Name",
            "Onboarding", "Participation", "Education"
          ],
        })
        .firstPage()

      if (records?.length > 0) {
        // Process onboarding status here
        const onboardingStatus = records[0].fields.Onboarding || 'Not set';
        const hasParticipation = records[0].fields.Participation &&
                               records[0].fields.Participation.length > 0;

        // Automatically set onboarding to "Applied" if participation exists
        if (hasParticipation && onboardingStatus !== "Applied") {
          await contactsTable.update(records[0].id, {
            "Onboarding": "Applied"
          });
          records[0].fields.Onboarding = "Applied";
        }

        // Return enhanced profile data
        return {
          contactId: records[0].id,
          ...records[0].fields,
          // Add processed properties
          hasActiveParticipation: hasParticipation,
          onboardingCompleted: onboardingStatus === "Applied" || hasParticipation
        }
      }

      return null
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching user profile:", error)
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch user profile")
    }
  }

  Recommendations for Implementation

  Based on my analysis, I would recommend:

  1. Create an Enhanced User Profile API:
    - Modify /api/user/profile.js to return a truly complete profile in a single call
    - Include participation, team data, onboarding status, and other frequently used data
    - Consider adding a parameter for "depth" to control how much related data to include
  2. Add Profile Prefetching:
    - Add profile prefetching in _app.js immediately after Auth0 initialization
    - Use React Query's prefetchQuery to start loading data early
    - Set appropriate staleTime to prevent unnecessary refetches
  3. Optimize Airtable.js:
    - Reduce the number of separate API calls by enhancing getUserProfile
    - Add a dedicated getEnhancedUserProfile method that includes related records
    - Use Airtable's formula functions more effectively to filter data server-side
  4. Improve Caching Strategy:
    - Implement a more aggressive caching strategy for profile data
    - Use React Query's staleTime and cacheTime options to reduce API calls
    - Consider implementing a service worker for offline support
  5. Implement Batched Queries:
    - For related data like team memberships and participation records
    - Reduce the number of API calls to Airtable

  Example Implementation Plan

  1. First, modify getUserProfile in airtable.js to always include and process the Onboarding field
  2. Then, enhance getCompleteUserProfile to fetch related data in parallel
  3. Next, implement profile prefetching in _app.js using React Query's prefetchQuery
  4. Finally, refactor components to use the enhanced profile data instead of making separate API calls

  This approach would significantly reduce API calls, improve performance, and fix the onboarding status issue by ensuring all data is available from the beginning.
