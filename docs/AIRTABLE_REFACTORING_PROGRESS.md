## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring more API routes to use the new architecture
2. Create more sample refactored components
3. Begin systematically replacing imports in the codebase
4. Develop a testing plan to ensure all functionality works correctly
5. Gradually phase out the old `airtable.js` implementation
