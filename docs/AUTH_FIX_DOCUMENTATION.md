# Authentication Fixes for Profile Updates

## Issue Overview

We fixed a persistent issue where profile updates were failing with `401 Unauthorized` errors despite the user being properly authenticated. The core problem was that the browser wasn't sending authentication cookies with PATCH requests due to security policies around secure cookies.

## Key Insights

1. **Secure Cookies and HTTPS**: Modern browsers require cookies marked as `secure` to be sent over HTTPS. This is especially enforced for "non-simple" HTTP methods like PATCH.

2. **SameSite Cookie Policies**: Using `sameSite: 'lax'` ensures better browser compatibility than `none`, while still allowing authentication cookies to work across different request types.

3. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: PATCH requests trigger preflight OPTIONS requests, which need proper CORS headers to maintain authentication state.

## Changes Made

### 1. Middleware.js Update

**What Changed**: Updated the `getBaseUrl` function to always use HTTPS instead of conditionally using HTTP for localhost.

**Why**: This ensures consistent protocol usage across the application, which is essential for secure cookies to be properly sent with all request types.

```javascript
// Before
const protocol = host.includes('localhost') ? 'http' : 'https';

// After
return `https://${host}`;
```

### 2. Auth0 Cookie Configuration

**What Changed**: Simplified cookie configuration to focus on the essential settings while keeping critical security options.

**Why**: The minimal configuration is less prone to errors while maintaining all required security settings.

```javascript
// Before
cookie: {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: 'lax',
  transient: false,
  domain: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '.xfoundry.org' : undefined
}

// After
cookie: {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: 'lax',
  domain: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '.xfoundry.org' : undefined
}
```

### 3. API Route CORS Handling

**What Changed**: Added proper CORS handlers for OPTIONS requests and simplified the API route implementation.

**Why**: PATCH requests trigger preflight OPTIONS requests that need correct CORS headers to maintain authentication.

```javascript
// Added OPTIONS handler
if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
  return res.status(200).end();
}
```

### 4. Fetch Request Configuration

**What Changed**: Simplified the fetch configuration in the useUpdateProfile mutation hook.

**Why**: Minimized code while keeping only the essential `credentials: 'include'` setting that ensures cookies are sent with requests.

```javascript
// Before
const response = await fetch(`/api/user/profile`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-Transaction-ID": transactionId
  },
  credentials: 'include',
  body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend),
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000)
});

// After
const response = await fetch(`/api/user/profile`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  credentials: 'include',
  body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend)
});
```

### 5. Next.js Configuration

**What Changed**: Updated next.config.mjs to ensure consistent HTTPS usage.

**Why**: This ensures that all URLs in the application use HTTPS, which is required for secure cookies to function properly.

## Codebase Design Principles

As requested, our approach to this project focuses on:

1. **Simplicity and Streamlined Implementation**: Using the simplest code necessary to achieve functionality. If a feature can be implemented with defaults, we prefer that over custom configurations.

2. **Avoid Explicit Settings When Unnecessary**: Only explicitly specifying parameters when they're different from defaults or when absolutely necessary for functionality.

3. **Following Official Patterns**: Adhering to the recommended implementation patterns from Auth0 and other libraries rather than creating custom solutions.

4. **Clean, Minimal Code**: Removing extraneous code, comments, and configurations that don't directly contribute to functionality.

5. **Using Default Handling Where Possible**: Leveraging default behaviors of libraries and frameworks when they meet our needs.

## Future Considerations

1. **Environment Consistency**: Ensure the development environment consistently uses HTTPS via the `--experimental-https` flag in package.json.

2. **Dependency Versions**: Keep Auth0 and NextJS packages updated to benefit from the latest security improvements.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: The current solution works across modern browsers, but if supporting older browsers becomes necessary, additional configuration might be needed.

4. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on authentication errors in logs to identify any regressions or new issues that might emerge.
