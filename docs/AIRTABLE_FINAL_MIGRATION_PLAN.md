# Airtable Final Migration Plan

This document outlines the final steps to complete the migration from the monolithic Airtable implementation to the new domain-driven architecture.

## Current Status

- ✅ All domain entity modules are implemented
- ✅ All React Query hooks are implemented
- ✅ Sample API routes and components have been refactored
- ✅ Basic migration tools are operational
- ✅ Initial testing has been performed on refactored components

## Final Migration Steps

### Phase 1: API Route Migration (2 weeks)

1. **Week 1: Analyze and Plan**
   - Categorize remaining API routes by complexity and dependencies
   - Identify which routes can be auto-migrated using the import script
   - Identify which routes need manual intervention
   - Create a prioritized list of routes to migrate

2. **Week 2: Execute API Migrations**
   - Apply import script to all auto-migratable routes
   - Manually refactor complex routes
   - Write tests for the refactored routes to ensure functionality
   - Update API route documentation

### Phase 2: Component Migration (3 weeks)

1. **Week 3: Dashboard Components**
   - Refactor high-priority dashboard components
   - Rename refactored components to replace originals
   - Test each component thoroughly before renaming
   - Update any dependent components

2. **Week 4: Program/Team Components**
   - Refactor program and team-related components
   - Test each component thoroughly before renaming
   - Update relevant documentation

3. **Week 5: Remaining Components**
   - Refactor all remaining components
   - Complete final testing
   - Verify component interactions

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Optimization (1 week)

1. **Week 6: Final Steps**
   - Remove the old `airtable.js` file once all dependencies are migrated
   - Optimize caching strategy based on real-world usage
   - Finalize documentation
   - Perform comprehensive performance testing

## Implementation Strategy

For each file to be migrated, follow this workflow:

1. **Analysis**
   - Review the file's imports and dependencies
   - Determine which entity modules and hooks will be needed
   - Identify any schema-specific code that needs to be updated

2. **Refactoring**
   - For API routes:
     - Update imports to use entity modules
     - Replace direct field access with normalized object properties
     - Update error handling to use standardized approach
   
   - For components:
     - Create a `.refactored.js` version if it doesn't exist
     - Implement using the appropriate hooks
     - Ensure all loading, error, and success states are properly handled

3. **Testing**
   - For API routes:
     - Test all routes with various input scenarios
     - Verify error responses match expected format
     - Ensure authentication works correctly
   
   - For components:
     - Test all loading states
     - Test error handling
     - Verify data rendering matches expected output
     - Check interactions with other components

4. **Deployment**
   - For API routes:
     - Rename or update the routes in place
     - Monitor error rates after deployment
   
   - For components:
     - Rename refactored components to replace originals
     - Update any import references in other components
     - Monitor usage in development before promoting to production

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Keep the original implementation available as a fallback
   - Use feature flags to toggle between implementations if needed
   - Back up files before renaming

2. **Monitoring**
   - Add temporary logging to track performance and error rates
   - Compare response times between old and new implementations
   - Monitor Airtable API usage to ensure efficiency

3. **Incremental Approach**
   - Migrate one domain area completely before moving to the next
   - Start with less critical areas to minimize business impact
   - Perform deployments outside of peak usage hours

## Test Plan

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test each entity function independently
   - Verify hooks behave as expected with mock data
   - Test error conditions and edge cases

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test API routes with real Airtable data
   - Verify hooks work correctly in components
   - Test caching behavior

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure response times with and without caching
   - Compare with the old implementation
   - Identify and optimize any performance bottlenecks

## Final Checklist

Before marking the migration as complete, ensure:

- [ ] All API routes are using the new architecture
- [ ] All components are using the new hooks
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance is equal to or better than the original implementation
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] No references to the old airtable.js file remain
- [ ] Monitoring shows no regressions in error rates or performance

## Timeline

| Week | Milestone | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1    | API Route Analysis and Planning | Not Started |
| 2    | API Route Migration | Not Started |
| 3    | Dashboard Component Migration | Not Started |
| 4    | Program/Team Component Migration | Not Started |
| 5    | Remaining Component Migration | Not Started |
| 6    | Cleanup and Optimization | Not Started |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All code references to the old airtable.js are removed
2. All components and API routes use the new architecture
3. No increase in error rates is observed
4. Response times are maintained or improved
5. The codebase is more maintainable and robust against schema changes
