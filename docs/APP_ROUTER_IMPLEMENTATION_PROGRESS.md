# App Router Implementation Progress

## Completed Components

### Authentication
- ✅ Auth0 middleware integration with App Router
- ✅ Created Auth0 callback route handler (`/app/auth/callback/route.js`)
- ✅ Created Auth0 callback page component (`/app/auth/callback/page.js`)
- ✅ Implemented `lib/app-router-auth.js` with helper functions
- ✅ Created login and logout route handlers
- ✅ Created API authentication utilities for route handlers

### Core Structure
- ✅ Root layout.js implementation
- ✅ Providers setup for Auth0, React Query, and contexts
- ✅ Dashboard layout and page structure
- ✅ Home page implementation
- ✅ Error and not-found pages
- ✅ Global CSS and theming

### Server-Side Components & API Routes
- ✅ Events module implementation:
  - Server-side data fetchers in `/app/lib/events.js`
  - API routes: `/app/api/events/[eventId]/route.js`, `/app/api/user/events/route.js`, etc.
  - Server Actions: `/app/actions/events/create-event.js`, `/app/actions/events/update-event.js`, `/app/actions/events/delete-event.js`
  - Server Components: `/app/dashboard/events/UpcomingEvents.js`, `/app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.js`
  - Client Components: `/app/dashboard/events/components/EventActionsClient.js`, `/app/dashboard/events/components/CreateEventForm.js`

- ✅ Institutions module implementation:
  - Server-side data fetchers in `/app/lib/institutions.js`
  - API routes: `/app/api/institutions/[institutionId]/route.js`, `/app/api/institutions/route.js`, etc.
  - Server Actions: `/app/actions/institutions/create-institution.js`, `/app/actions/institutions/update-institution.js`, `/app/actions/institutions/create-partnership.js`

- ✅ Profile module implementation (initial version):
  - Server Actions: `/app/actions/profile/update-profile.js`, `/app/actions/profile/update-profile-with-formstate.js`
  - API Routes: `/app/api/user/profile/route.js`
  - Profile page component: `/app/dashboard/profile/page.js`

## Newly Added Components

### Dashboard Pages
- ✅ Dashboard main page with suspense boundaries
- ✅ Profile page with server data fetching
- ✅ Client component wrappers for interactive elements

### Auth Routes
- ✅ Login route handler
- ✅ Logout route handler
- ✅ Callback route handler

### API Routes
- ✅ User profile API route with authentication

## Remaining Items

### Authentication
- Implement login and registration pages in App Router format
- Improve error handling in auth flows

### Dashboard Components
- Create server components for:
  - Programs listing and detail pages
  - Teams management
  - Events listing with filters
  - Resources and rewards sections

### User Onboarding
- Migrate onboarding process to App Router

### API Routes
- Complete API routes migration for remaining entities:
  - Teams
  - Programs
  - Participation
  - Resources
  - Points
  - Partnerships

### Testing
- Test all auth flows
- Test dashboard layout and functionality
- Test data fetching and caching

## Implementation Strategy

The migration strategy uses a hybrid approach:

1. Core App Router structure is in place with layouts, error handling, and authentication
2. Dashboard and profile pages implemented with server components and suspense boundaries
3. API routes follow the new pattern with proper authentication
4. Server Actions are used for mutations with proper cache invalidation
5. Client components are used for interactive elements that need browser APIs

## Next Steps

1. Complete migrations for remaining Pages Router pages:
   - Team creation and management
   - Program application flows
   - Submission handling
   - Onboarding flow

2. Implement remaining API routes and server actions:
   - Teams API
   - Programs API
   - User participation API

3. Create more server components that consume the data fetchers:
   - Programs section with real data
   - Teams section with real data
   - Events section with real data

4. Improve error handling and loading states throughout the application:
   - Add proper skeleton loaders
   - Implement error boundaries at component level
