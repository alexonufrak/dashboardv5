// NOTE: This file is a placeholder for future App Router-specific middleware.
// Currently, authentication is handled by the root middleware.js file,
// which uses Auth0 middleware for the entire application.

// When fully migrating to App Router, merge the logic from the root middleware.js
// into this file and update imports as needed.

// This file is currently not active. See /middleware.js for authentication logic.
